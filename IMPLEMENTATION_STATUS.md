# HarmonyChain Implementation Status

## 🎯 Current Status: Active Development

**Last Updated**: January 2025

This document provides an honest assessment of what's working, what's mock/placeholder, and what needs to be implemented for production.

- **Wallet Connection**: RainbowKit integration configured
- **Routing**: Next.js app router with all pages
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **State Management**: React hooks and context

### Backend (Express.js)
- **API Routes**: REST endpoints implemented with basic CRUD operations
- **Middleware**: Authentication, error handling, rate limiting
- **Database**: SimpleDB with JSON file storage (contains sample data)
- **File Upload**: Multer integration for file handling
- **CORS**: Proper CORS configuration

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity Contracts**: All contracts written and compiled
- **ABI Definitions**: Complete ABI interfaces
- **Deployment Scripts**: Hardhat deployment configuration
- **Testing**: Basic contract tests

## 🚧 Partially Working (Mock/Sample Data Mode)

### IPFS Integration
- **Status**: Mock mode by default, real IPFS with credentials
- **Working**: File upload with validation
- **Mock Mode**: Generates fake IPFS hashes for development
- **Real Mode**: Requires `PINATA_API_KEY` and `PINATA_SECRET_KEY`
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to mock mode

### Blockchain Integration
- **Status**: Smart contracts ready but not deployed
- **Working**: Contract interfaces and method calls
- **Mock Mode**: Returns fake data for development
- **Real Mode**: Requires deployed contracts and proper addresses
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to mock mode

### Authentication
- **Status**: JWT tokens working, SIWE backend ready
- **Working**: JWT token generation and validation
- **SIWE**: Backend implementation complete, frontend integration needed
- **Session Management**: Basic session handling implemented

### Database
- **Status**: Using JSON files with sample data
- **Working**: CRUD operations with sample data
- **Sample Data**: Contains tracks, artists, NFTs, and other entities
- **Production Ready**: No, needs migration to proper database

## ❌ Not Fully Implemented

### Real Data Integration
- **Blockchain Events**: No real blockchain event listening
- **Transaction History**: Sample transaction data only
- **Analytics**: Sample analytics data
- **Revenue Tracking**: No real revenue calculation

### Production Features
- **Database Migration**: Still using JSON files with sample data
- **Caching**: No request caching implemented
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting only
- **Monitoring**: No production monitoring
- **Logging**: Basic console logging only

## 🔧 Configuration Required for Production

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for real IPFS
PINATA_API_KEY=your-pinata-api-key
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your-pinata-secret-key

# Required for real blockchain
MUSIC_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
NFT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=0x...
ROYALTY_DISTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS=0x...
GOVERNANCE_DAO_ADDRESS=0x...

# Required for production
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
NETWORK=harmony-mainnet
BLOCKCHAIN_MOCK_MODE=false
IPFS_MOCK_MODE=false
```

### Smart Contract Deployment
1. Deploy contracts to Harmony network
2. Update contract addresses in environment
3. Verify contract functionality
4. Test all contract interactions

### Database Migration
1. Choose production database (PostgreSQL recommended)
2. Create database schema
3. Migrate data from JSON files
4. Update database connection in code
