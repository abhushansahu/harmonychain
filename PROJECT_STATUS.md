# HarmonyChain - Project Status

## 🎯 Current Status: Development Phase

**Last Updated**: January 2025

This document provides an accurate, honest assessment of the HarmonyChain project's current state.

## ✅ What's Working

### Core Infrastructure
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo setup with proper workspace configuration
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across all packages
- **Build System**: Working build and development scripts
- **Package Management**: Proper dependency management

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **UI Components**: All React components implemented and functional
- **Pages**: Complete page structure for all major features
- **Routing**: Next.js app router working
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **Wallet Integration**: RainbowKit configured for wallet connection

### Backend (Express.js)
- **API Endpoints**: REST API with CRUD operations for all entities
- **Middleware**: Authentication, error handling, rate limiting
- **Database**: SimpleDB with JSON file storage
- **File Upload**: Multer integration for file handling
- **CORS**: Proper CORS configuration

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity Contracts**: All contracts written and compiled
- **ABI Definitions**: Complete interface definitions
- **Deployment Scripts**: Hardhat configuration ready

## 🚧 What's In Development

### Database
- **Status**: Using JSON files with sample data
- **Sample Data**: Contains tracks, artists, NFTs, playlists, etc.
- **Production Ready**: No, needs migration to proper database

### IPFS Integration
- **Status**: Mock mode working, real IPFS requires configuration
- **Mock Mode**: Generates fake IPFS hashes for development
- **Real Mode**: Requires Pinata API keys
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to mock mode

### Blockchain Integration
- **Status**: Smart contracts ready but not deployed
- **Mock Mode**: Returns fake data for development
- **Real Mode**: Requires contract deployment and configuration
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to mock mode

### Authentication
- **Status**: JWT tokens working, SIWE partially implemented
- **JWT**: Token generation and validation working
- **SIWE**: Backend ready, frontend integration needed
- **Session Management**: Basic session handling implemented

## ❌ What's Not Implemented

### Real Data Integration
- **Blockchain Events**: No real blockchain event listening
- **Transaction History**: Sample transaction data only
- **Analytics**: Sample analytics data
- **Revenue Tracking**: No real revenue calculation

### Production Features
- **Database Migration**: Still using JSON files
- **Caching**: No request caching implemented
- **Monitoring**: No production monitoring
- **Logging**: Basic console logging only

## 🔧 Configuration Required for Production

### Environment Variables
```bash
# For real IPFS
PINATA_API_KEY=your-pinata-api-key
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your-pinata-secret-key
IPFS_MOCK_MODE=false

# For real blockchain
MUSIC_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
NFT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=0x...
ROYALTY_DISTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS=0x...
GOVERNANCE_DAO_ADDRESS=0x...
NETWORK=harmony-mainnet
BLOCKCHAIN_MOCK_MODE=false

# For production
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Smart Contract Deployment
1. Deploy contracts to Harmony network
2. Update contract addresses in environment
3. Verify contract functionality
4. Test all contract interactions

### Database Migration
1. Choose production database (PostgreSQL recommended)
2. Create database schema
3. Migrate data from JSON files
4. Update database connection in code

## 🚀 Development vs Production

### Development Mode (Current)
- Uses mock IPFS and blockchain services
- No external API keys required
- Perfect for UI development and testing
- All features work with sample data

### Production Mode (Target)
- Requires all environment variables
- Real IPFS and blockchain connections
- Deployed smart contracts
- Real database and data persistence

## 📊 Feature Matrix

| Feature | UI | API | Database | Blockchain | Status |
|---------|----|----|----------|------------|--------|
| **Music Discovery** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 Mock | Working with sample data |
| **Track Upload** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 Mock | Interface ready, needs real IPFS |
| **NFT Marketplace** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 Mock | Working with sample data |

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Development
1. Continue UI/UX improvements
2. Add more comprehensive testing
3. Implement SIWE frontend integration
4. Add real-time features

### For Production
1. Deploy smart contracts to Harmony network
2. Set up real IPFS service (Pinata)
3. Migrate to production database
4. Configure all environment variables
5. Set up monitoring and logging

## 📝 Summary

**Current State**: The HarmonyChain platform has a complete UI and basic infrastructure with sample data. It's ready for development and testing, but requires configuration for production deployment.

**What Works**: All UI components, API endpoints, and basic functionality work with sample data.

**What Needs Work**: Real blockchain integration, IPFS configuration, database migration, and production deployment setup.

**Ready for**: Development, testing, UI/UX work, and feature development.

**Not Ready for**: Production deployment without proper configuration.
